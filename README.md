Good developers regularly check in on the news in their field -- every day, not every week or month! In order to stay up to date, you will need to do the following in order to create your own dashboard: 

List out the technologies in which you're interested.

List out some news sites where you could find tech-related news.

Create a dashboard that will help you stay up to date (for example a dashboard on Feedly), including the latest updates from the sites you listed above. 

Create a Twitter account (if you don't already have one) and follow different influencers in the world of web development.
